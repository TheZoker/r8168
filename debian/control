Description: dkms source for the r8168 network driver
 r8168 is the Linux device driver released by RealTek for their network
 controllers with PCI-Express interface:
  * 10/100/1000M Gigabit Ethernet: RTL8111B, RTL8111C, RTL8111D, RTL8111E,
    RTL8111F, RTL8111G, RTL8111H, RTL8118A, RTL8119i, RTL8111L, RTL8111K,
    RTL8168B, RTL8168E, RTL8168H, RTL8111DP, RTL8111EP(P), RTL8111FP,
    RTL8411, RTL8411B
 .
 This driver should only be used for devices not yet supported by the
 in-kernel driver r8169. Please see the README.Debian for instructions how
 to report bugs against r8169 that made it necessary to use r8168-dkms.
 .
 Installation of the r8168-dkms package will disable the in-kernel r8169
 module. To re-enable r8169, the r8168-dkms package must be purged.
 .
 This package provides the dkms source code for the r8168 kernel module.
 Kernel source or headers are required to compile the module.
 .
 Building the kernel module has been tested up to Linux ${r8168:tested:Linux}.
